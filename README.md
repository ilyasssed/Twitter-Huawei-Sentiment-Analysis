# Twitter-Huawei-Sentiment-Analysis
I present to you some Jupyter Notebooks that will help you stream tweets and do sentiment analysis on them using the Textblob Library. You can change the words you want to search in the settings file. Don't forget to change the credentials first. 
The Streaming Twitter file enables you to download the Tweets from Twitter, based on the word on the settings file, and save the data as a csv file.
The Sentiment Analysis file, does some ploting to make you understand better the data. This code was based on some existing code, and I added some of my own.
